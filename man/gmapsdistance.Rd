\title{Compute Distance with Google Maps}
\usage{
gmapsdistance(origin, destination, combinations = c("all", "pairwise"),
  time = NULL, time_type = c("now", "depart_at", "arrive_by"),
  mode = c("driving", "walking", "bicycling", "transit"), avoid = c(),
  traffic_model = c("best_guess", "pessimistic", "optimistic"),
  key = get_api_key())
}
\arguments{
\item{origin}{A string containing the description of the starting point.
Should be inside of quoutes (""). If more than one word is used, they
should be separated by a plus sign e.g. "Bogota+Colombia". Coordinates in
LAT-LONG format are also a valid input as long as they can be identified by
Google Maps.}

\item{destination}{A string containing the description of the end point.
Should be the same format as the variable "origin".}

\item{combinations}{Which combinations of origin and destination should be made.
Can be either "all", or "pairwise".}

\item{time}{Used for specifying departure or arrival times.}

\item{time_type}{Must be either "now", "depart_at", or "arrive_by".}

\item{mode}{A string containing the mode of transportation desired. Should be
inside of double quotes (",") and one of the following: "bicycling",
"walking", "transit" or "driving".}

\item{avoid}{Whether to avoid "tolls", "highways", "ferries" or "indoor".}

\item{traffic_model}{Whether to use a "best_guess", "pessimistic", or "optimistic" traffic model.}

\item{key}{In order to use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API it is
necessary to have an API key. The key should be inside of quotes. Example:
"THISISMYKEY". This key an also be set using \code{set_api_key("THISISMYKEY")}.}

\description{
The function gmapsdistance uses the Google Maps Distance Matrix API in order
to compute the distance between two points. In order to be able to use the
function you will need an API key and enable the Distance Matrix API in the
Google Developers Console For more information about how to get a key, go to
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/get-api-key#key
